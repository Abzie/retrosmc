retrosmc by mcobit
An easier way to get a partial retropie onto osmc without altering system-relevant stuff.

This contains work from the RetroPie project as well as some open source libraries and binaries like SDL1.2/2 etc.
Also thus is an alpha release right now. So I am not responsible for anything you do with this to your system.

Please download and run install-retrosmc.sh from this repository on your osmc home directory.
